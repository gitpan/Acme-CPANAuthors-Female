SYNOPSIS
       use Acme::CPANAuthors;
       use Acme::CPANAuthors::Female;

       my $authors = Acme::CPANAuthors->new('Female');

       my $number   = $authors->count;
       my @ids      = $authors->id;
       my @distros  = $authors->distributions('AUDREYT');

DESCRIPTION
    This class is used to provide a hash of female CPAN author's PAUSE
    id/name to Acme::CPANAuthors. I started this out of sheer curiosity; I
    happen to be a male myself.

    If you are a female and/or can confirm more females among us CPAN
    authors, please fork the github repository and supply a patch.
